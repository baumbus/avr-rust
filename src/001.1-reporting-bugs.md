# 1.1. Reporting bugs

Bugs in this guide can be reported at the [GitHub repository for the book](https://github.com/baumbus/avr-rust).

Bugs in Rust should be reported to Rust itself, ideally with the `[AVR]`  prefix on the issue title.
After creation, the triage team will tag the issue as O-AVR for you.

Bugs in ecosystem crates should be reported directly on the relevant crate's issue tracker where possible.

If unclear, feel free to message the kind folks in the [avr-rust Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/avr-rust/Lobby) for advice. Don't worry if you
can't track it down to the right place 100% - know that it is better to report a bug in the wrong place than
to not report it at all!
